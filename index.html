    <p>Betty Collins passed away peacefully on February 9, 2024, in Jacksonville, Florida, just
      days before turning 89.
      Born in Jacksonville on February 12, 1935, she spent the majority of her life there. While most of her life was
      spent in Jacksonville, she also lived briefly in Palatka, Orlando, and Brunswick, Georgia. Despite these moves,
      Jacksonville was always her true home.</p>

    </a>
    <p>Betty began her career at First Guaranty Bank before she had even graduated from Robert E. Lee High School,
      embarking on what would become a remarkable 38-year journey, during which she worked in multiple departments
      before retiring. Her tenure was not just long but historic, making her the bank's longest-serving employee, a
      badge of honor that reflected her unwavering commitment and dedication.</p>

    <p>Even after retirement, Betty maintained a strong connection with her former colleagues, gathering annually to
      reminisce about their shared experiences, showcasing her loyalty and the deep bonds formed throughout her career.

    <p>Betty's life was marked by her trailblazing spirit as a career woman during a time when it was not widely
      accepted. Despite the controversy surrounding women in the workforce at the time, Betty prioritized her
      professional life. Yet, she deeply loved her family, considering her children, grandchildren, and
      great-grandchildren among her proudest accomplishments and never hesitating to extend her care to those in need.
    </p>

    <p>Following a severe car accident that rendered her sister Patricia unable to care for her child, Betty
      unhesitatingly welcomed her niece Alison into her family, raising her as her own daughter. When her son-in-law
      Mark's parents were critically ill, Betty and her late husband Pat took on the care of their grandson Brandon.
      This not only offered Mark and Lynda the peace of mind needed to tend to Mark's parents in their last days but
      also fostered cherished memories for Brandon, particularly of tending to the fruit trees in the backyard with
      Betty. Betty even took a job as a crossing guard at his elementary school, ensuring she was there to greet him
      after school where he served on the safety patrol. Additionally, Betty provided unwavering support to George, the
      adopted son of her late husband Pat in Palatka, helping him navigate his journey with multiple sclerosis.</p>

    <p>A gifted conversationalist, Betty made friends wherever she went, particularly at the Edgewood Condominiums and
      Silver Treasures at Lane Ave.</p>

    <p>Betty met Bill O'Byrne, the sunset love of her life, at the Florida Edgewood Condominiums, where their love story
      began with daily walks to the St. Johns River. Bill noticed Betty's unsteadiness and offered his hand, a simple
      act that marked the start of their companionship. Together, they delighted in feeding and naming the squirrels
      along their route, and their evenings were often spent in the quiet joy of assembling puzzles. These shared
      pleasures deepened their connection, weaving into the fabric of their twilight years together.</p>

    <p>Betty was preceded in death by her parents, Guy and Mary Louise Hollingsworth; her son, Steve Hart; her sister,
      Patricia Roy; and sisters-in-law, Margaret Ann and Maureen Hollingsworth. Her memory lives on through her husband,
      Bill O’Byrne; children, Lynda Jolly (Mark) and Alison Bennett (Glen); grandchildren, Amber Hollister (Ray),
      Brandon Jolly, Stephanie Hart Caterinichia (Logan), Davis, and Noah Bennett; three great-grandchildren; siblings,
      Mike and Larry Hollingsworth (Cindy); and numerous nieces and nephews.</p>

    <p>A memorial service will be held in her honor on Friday, February 23, 2024, at 11 a.m. at Edgewood Avenue
      Christian Church, where Betty's life will be celebrated and remembered.</p>

    <p>For those who prefer an alternative to sending flowers, a donation to <a
        href="https://edgewoodavenuecc.org/">Edgewood Avenue Christian Church</a> in memory of Betty Collins is warmly
      welcomed.</p>
